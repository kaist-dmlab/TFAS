## Abstract
Designing effective neural networks from scratch for various time-series analysis tasks, such as activity recognition, fault detection, and traffic forecasting, is time-consuming and heavily relies on human labor. This paper thereby aims to answer the following question: how to build a unified zero-shot neural architecture search framework that effectively designs neural ar- chitectures for a variety of tasks and input time series? However, building a universal framework for different tasks comes with challenges. First, we need a unified backbone search space that performs well across diverse analysis tasks. Second, we need a time series-aware zero-shot proxy that consistently correlates with the downstream performance across different characteristics of time-series datasets. To address these challenges, for the first time, we propose a framework for general Time-series analysis with zero-shot Neural Architecture Search named TimesNAS. TimesNAS extends a state-of-the-art foundation model into a two- level search space and enhances a zero-shot proxy by exploiting decomposed time-series properties. Empirically, we show that the architectures found by TimesNAS gain improvement up to 23.6% over state-of-the-art hand-crafted baselines in five mainstream time-series data mining tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation.
